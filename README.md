# Veggie Tales

## Storyteller / Veggie tales
Image classification app + text creation via openai API


## Description

### App

We built a Streamlit app structured in three main sections. In the first, the user can upload an image or take a picture of a vegetable that will then be classified according to a list of 16 classes. The second is intended for kids; based on the detected vegetable, openai API creates four facts and a story that are meant for the user to learn about the ingredient. The third is intended for a broader audience. The user gets five specific facts (historical, cultural, health, fun and bad) and a recipe suggestion. 

For details on dependencies and libraries check [requirements.txt](). For getting your own API key for openai, follow [this]() link

### Image classification model

Classification is performed via the pre-trained deep learning model [InceptionV3](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/inception_v3) from Tensorflow. We unfroze the last 15 layers and trained them on 16 classes of the  [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kritikseth/fruit-and-vegetable-image-recognition) Fruits and Vegetables Image Recognition from kaggle. For details see the related [notebook]().

Previously, we built up our own deep learning model, trained on two of the above *mentioned classes*. *Accuracy*. For details see the related [notebook](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication).



### Outlook
* Add text to speech option for listening to the text parts of the app
* Increase the number of classes within the vegetable category and/or other categories (like fruits)
* Add personalized text generation
